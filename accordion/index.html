          <b>This is the 1-item's accordion body.</b> It is shown by default, until the collapse plugin adds the
          appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well
          as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our
          default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the .accordion-body, though
          the transition does limit overflow.
